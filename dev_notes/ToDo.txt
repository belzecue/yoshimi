BUG! If jack is selected for audio but there are no physical ports Yoshimi quits with CLI warning - should run with gui warning as well, or better still loop back to try alsa.

Minor bug Multi instances produce jack error reports when main instance closed, even if they have been closed first - been there since V 1.4.1 :(

Master UI windows makes direct calls to FileMgrFuncs :(

Revise GUI voice list related to voice editor.

Complete effect change warning for dynfitter insert.

Sort out bank properly.

CLI sys/ins updates wrong.

Some CLI addvoice kit mode controls don't update the GUI.

CLI waveform (in voice) changes don't update GUI unless waveform window is open too.

Find out why reporting errors in 'Bank' is very slow.

Realtime subnote

Realtime filters

Requested: auto 'apply' timer for padsynth.

Do a dual scan for banks so that IDd ones are found first, then any new ones picked up on the second scan. This stops known ones being re-ordered when 'foreign' entries appear from outside Yoshimi.

Expand MIDI-learn to include:
    learn groups
    GUI view by group but CLI and running search only by CC & chan

Make NRPN MIDI-learn able to be re-learned.

LV2: internal sound banks do not appear to be exposed as LV2 presets
Visible in carla apparently.

Startup state load doesn't set buffersize correctly - partially resolved. Size is ignored if loaded when already running (which is reasonable).

Make stored values of things like Echo delay 32 bit unsigned integers.

Consider enabling and disabling tooltips.

RPNs (channel based)

101,0 (MSB)

100,0 Pitch bend range
100,1 Fine detune
100,2 Coarse detune

Improve Copy & Paste functionality.
