V1.6.0

Yoshimi is now 10 years old and (while fully respecting its origins) is forging it's own path into the future. Do come along for the ride.


Our headline feature is extensions to AddSynth voices and modulators.

There is a new AddSynth noise type.

There are extra mute options.

There is a global bank search entry in the main window's instrument menu, and a button in the instrument bank window.

Also in the main window there is a button to temporarily disable an individual system effect.

In the part editor window there is now a 'Humanise Velocity' slider.

We've made an improvement to the way recent histories are managed.

All the above features are, of course, also available to the command line interface.

'Reports' and 'Midi Learn' openers have been swapped.

There is a new group of easy to use NRPNs.

There have been improvements to Copy/Paste.

There is tighter control of startup.

Incidentally, whenever we add new features, the default is always to keep the existing behaviour.

The Advanced User Manual has been considerably Expanded.


Under the hood

Ring buffers have now been changed to a bespoke type.

Almost all file system operations have been moved to a single source file.

As well as running headless, Yoshimi can now be built headless.

The command line has additional protection against overlength lines, and corrupted data.
